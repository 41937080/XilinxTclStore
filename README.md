# Xilinx Tcl Store

Welcome to the Xilinx Tcl Store GitHub Repository!

The Tcl Store is an open source repository of Tcl code designed primarily, but not necessarily for use with the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.  An app is a grouping or collection of one or more Tcl scripts that is published and maintained by an owner.  The app owner acts as a gatekeeper for that code and we only accept contributions for an app from the owner.  In addition, the entire repository is managed by a Xilinx gatekeeper that controls pushes to the public repo.
