Example:
    
  set name "ProgressTest"
  set group "SynthesisTests"
  set expected "100%"
  set progress [ get_property PROGRESS [ get_runs synth_1 ] ]
  set msg "synth_1 is not at 100%"

  # checks that synth_1 progress is at 100% else the error is logged and the flow is stopped
  ::xilinx::junit::assert_same $expected $progress $msg $name $group

  # checks that synth_1 progress is at 100% else an error is logged and the flow continues
  if { [ catch { ::xilinx::junit::assert_same $expected $progress $msg $name $group } error ] } {
    puts "ERROR: $error"
    pits "Process will now continue..."
  }
