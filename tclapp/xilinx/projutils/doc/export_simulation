Description:

  Export a simulation driver script file for the target simulator. The generated
  script will contain simulator commands for compiling, elaborating and simulating
  the design.

  This command will retrieve the simulation compile order for the specified object
  and export this information in a text file with the compiler commands and default
  options for the target simulator. The specified object can be either a simulation
  fileset or an IP.

  This command will also copy the data files if any from the fileset or an IP to the
  output directory. If the design contains "Verilog" sources, then the "glbl.v" file
  will also be copied from the software installation to the output directory.

Arguments:

  -of_objects - (Optional) Specify the target object for which the simulation driver
  script file needs to be generated. The target object can be either a simulation
  fileset (simset) or an IP. If this option is not specified then this command will
  generate driver file for the current simulation fileset "top".
  
  -relative_to - (Optional) Specify the directory path wrt which the project sources
  and include directories will be made "relative to" in the generated driver file.

  -32bit - (Optional) Specify this option to perform 32bit simulation. If this option
  is not specified then by default 64bit option will be added to the command line.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite an existing driver script file of the same name. If
  the script file already exists, the tool returns an error unless the -force argument
  is specified. 

  -simulator - (Required) Specify the simulator name for which the simulation script
   needs to be generated. The valid simulators are "ies" and "vcs_mx".

  -dir - (Required) Specify the directory path where the simulation files will be exported.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, ignoring any command line errors
  and returning no messages. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return all messages
  from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command exports a driver script file for "IES" simulator named
  "bft_tb_sim_ies.txt" in the current directory for the "bft_core" example project:-

  % export_simulation -simulator ies -dir "."

  The following command overwrites an existing "bft_tb_sim_ies.txt" file:-

  % export_simulation -force -simulator ies -dir "."

  The following command exports a driver script file named "bft_tb_sim_ies.txt" in the
  "./test_bft_ies" directory for the "bft_core" example project. The glbl.v file is also
  copied in the specified directory:-

  % export_simulation -simulator ies -dir "test_bft_ies"

  The following command exports a driver script file "bft_tb_sim_vcs_mx.txt" for the
  "VCS_MX" simulator in the specified output directory with the design source file
  paths in the script file set relative to the current directory:-

  % export_simulation -relative_to "." -force -simulator vcs_mx -dir "test_bft_vcs_mx"
