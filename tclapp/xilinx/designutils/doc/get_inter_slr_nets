  Description: 

     Get all the inter-SLR nets.

     This command must be run on a placed or routed design.
     
     This command is runtime intensive and can take several hours to complete
     on a very large design. 
     
     If the design is routed, the command ::xilinx::designutils::get_sll_nets 
     should be used instead as it is much faster.

  Example:
  
     set nets [::xilinx::designutils::get_inter_slr_nets]
