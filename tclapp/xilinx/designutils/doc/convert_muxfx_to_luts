
  Description: Create CDC report for each clock-pair in the design

     Replaces all the MUXFX (MUXF7 and MUXF8) cells within an open synthesized design
     with LUT3 cells.  The design must be unplaced and the MUXFX cells cannot be part
     of a primitive macro.

  Example:

     The following example creates will replace all the MUXF7 and MUXF8 cells within
     within the opened synthesized design.

       convert_muxfx_to_luts
