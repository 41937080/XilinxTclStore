  # print alert to stdout
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_alert "An error was encountered\n"

  # print alert to an ASCII log
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_alert "An error was encountered\n" report.log

  # print alert to HTML file
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_alert "An error was encountered\n" report.html

  # print alert to an HTML log using global default
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::set_global_report report.html
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_alert "An error was encountered\n"

  #       See these other commands help for more information
