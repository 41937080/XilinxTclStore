Example:

  # print header to stdout
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_header "Heading for Section\n"

  # print header to an ASCII log
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_header "Heading for Section\n" report.log

  # print header to HTML file
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_header "Heading for Section\n" report.html

  # print header to an HTML log using global default
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::set_global_report report.html
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_header "Heading for Section\n"

  #       See these other commands help for more information
