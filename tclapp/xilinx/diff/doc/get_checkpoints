Example:

  # returns a list of the two checkpoints loaded with 'open_checkpoints', 
  # or manually set with 'set_checkpoints'
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::open_checkpoints ./test/design1.dcp ./test/design2.dcp
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::get_checkpoints 
  ./test/design1.dcp ./test/design2.dcp

  # manually set checkpoints
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::set_checkpoints ./test/design1.dcp ./test/design2.dcp
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::get_checkpoints 
  ./test/design1.dcp ./test/design2.dcp

  # Note: this command returns an empty list when checkpoints have not been set
