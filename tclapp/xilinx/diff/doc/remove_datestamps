Example:

  set report1 "timing1.log"
  report_timing -file $report1 -max_paths 1000 

  set report1_data [ ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::serialize_from_file $report1 ]
  set report2_data [ report_timing -return_string -max_paths 1000 ]

  # manually filter '| Command.*' to deal with:
  #| Command      : report_timing -file timing1.log -max_paths 1000
  #| Command      : report_timing -return_string -max_paths 1000
  set report1_data [ regsub -all -line {(\|\ Command)(.*)} $report1_data {\1<removed>} ]
  set report2_data [ regsub -all -line {(\|\ Command)(.*)} $report2_data {\1<removed>} ]

  # will report differences due to timestamps/datestamps
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::compare_lines $report1_data $report3_data

  # will report same now that the timestamps / datestamps have been removed
  set report1_ds [ ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::remove_datestamps $report1_data ] 
  set report2_ds [ ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::remove_datestamps $report3_data ]
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::compare_lines $report1_ds $report2_ds
