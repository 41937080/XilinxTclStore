Example:

  # print start to stdout
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_start "Title for My Difference Report\n"

  Title for My Difference Report


  # print start to an ASCII log
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_start "Title for My Difference Report\n" report.log

  # print start to HTML file
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_start "Title for My Difference Report\n" report.html

  # print start to an HTML log using global default
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::set_global_report report.html
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_start "Title for My Difference Report\n"


  # This command adds the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML tags to the start of the report
  # if and only if it is an HTML report (file name ends with .htm or .html).

  # Note: When using HTML, it is best to call print_start, print_header, (print_*), print_end
  #       See these other commands help for more information
