Example:

  # print results to stdout
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_results "I'm what you were looking for\n"
  I'm what you were looking for

  # print results to an ASCII log
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_results "I'm what you were looking for\n" report.log

  # print results to HTML file
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_results "I'm what you were looking for\n" report.html

  # print results to an HTML log using global default
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::set_global_report report.html
  ::tclapp::xilinx::diff::print_results "I'm what you were looking for\n"


  # Note: When using HTML, it is best to call print_start, print_header, (print_*), print_end
  #       See these other commands help for more information
