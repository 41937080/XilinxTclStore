Example:

  # returns a list of lists of objects loaded into memory for comparison
  #   the first item is the list of checkpoints loaded (in chronological order)
  #   the second item is the list of projects loaded (in chronological order)

  set design2  [ open_checkpoint design2.dcp ]
  set project2 [ current_project ]
