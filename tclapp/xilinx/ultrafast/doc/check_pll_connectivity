
  Description: Report MMCM/PLL information
  
     This command displays the signals hooked up to each PLL and
     MMCM in the design.  A warning is displayed if the RST port or
     LOCKED port are not connected to signals.  Floating inputs are
     also reported.  Display of outputs that are No-Connects can be
     optionally disabled by setting display_no_connects to 0.
   
     check_pll and check_mmcm control which of PLL and/or MMCM's are
     checked.  By default, both are checked.  Setting check_pll to
     0 disables PLL checking while setting check_mmcm to 0 disables
     MMCM checking.

  Example:
     check_pll_connectivity
     check_pll_connectivity -mmcm
     check_pll_connectivity -mmcm -hide_unconnected -file myreport.rpt -append
