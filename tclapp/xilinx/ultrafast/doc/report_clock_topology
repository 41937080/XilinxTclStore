     Generates a Clock Topology Report.  The report shows the path
     for each created clock (i.e., only traces clocks that have
     already been created. Does not trace clocks that haven't been
     defined).

  Example:
     report_clock_topology
     report_clock_topology -no_redundant_path -full_report -file myreport.rpt
